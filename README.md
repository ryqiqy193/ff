# FixedFloat Lightning-Fast Crypto Exchange: No KYC Required, Instant Swaps, Competitive Rates

So here's the thing about crypto exchanges - most of them want your life story before letting you swap a single coin. Birth certificate, social security number, probably your grandmother's maiden name too. FixedFloat? They couldn't care less who you are.

This instant cryptocurrency exchange has been around since 2018, and they've built their whole reputation on one simple idea: you should be able to swap crypto without jumping through bureaucratic hoops. No registration. No identity verification. Just you, your wallet, and whatever coins you want to trade.

## What Makes FixedFloat Different

FixedFloat operates as a non-custodial exchange, which is a fancy way of saying they never actually hold your funds. You're not depositing money into their system and hoping they'll give it back later. Instead, everything happens in real-time - you send crypto from your wallet, they process the swap automatically, and the new coins land in your destination wallet. The whole thing typically wraps up in minutes.

The platform supports around 68 different cryptocurrencies as of 2026, covering all the usual suspects - Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, Monero - plus a bunch of tokens across multiple networks like BEP20, ERC20, TRC20, and the Lightning Network. They've also integrated with newer chains like Sonic and maintained support for privacy coins like Monero, which many exchanges have dropped.

## Two Rate Options: Pick Your Strategy

Here's where it gets interesting. FixedFloat gives you two ways to execute trades, and your choice depends on how much risk you're willing to take for a better deal.

**Fixed Rate (1% fee):** You see a price, you lock it in for 10 minutes, and that's what you get. Period. If Bitcoin suddenly tanks while your transaction confirms, you still get the amount shown when you created the order. The catch? You pay 1% for this certainty, and you need to send the exact amount within those 10 minutes. If the market moves more than 1.2% before your transaction hits the blockchain, they'll ask if you want to continue at the new rate or get a refund.

**Float Rate (0.5% fee):** This one's for the gamblers. You pay half the commission, but the final rate gets set when your transaction receives the necessary confirmations. Market goes up? You win. Market goes down? Well, that's on you. The platform processes whatever the going rate is when everything confirms, typically within 10 minutes.

Both options charge network fees on top - those go to miners and validators, not FixedFloat. The platform's transparent about this, showing you the full breakdown before you commit.

## Pricing Breakdown

| Exchange Type | Service Fee | Rate Lock Period | Best For |
|--------------|-------------|------------------|----------|
|  [Fixed Rate](https://ff.io) | 1% + network fee | 10 minutes | Users wanting price certainty and predictable outcomes |
|  [Float Rate](https://ff.io) | 0.5% + network fee | Set at confirmation | Users willing to accept market volatility for lower fees |

## How to Use FixedFloat

The exchange interface is refreshingly simple. You pick what you're sending, what you want to receive, enter your receiving address (or scan a QR code if you're on mobile), choose fixed or float, and hit exchange. That's it.

No account creation. No email verification. No waiting 24 hours for withdrawal approval. The platform generates a unique address for your order, you send your crypto there, and once it confirms on the blockchain, they automatically process the swap and send your new coins to the address you provided.

They've recently redesigned the interface to work smoothly across all devices, and they support 14 languages now, with more coming. The whole experience feels like what crypto was supposed to be in the first place - fast, private, and straightforward.

## The Affiliate Program That Actually Pays

If you're into crypto and have an audience, FixedFloat's affiliate program is worth knowing about. They pay 40% of their profit from every exchange your referrals make. That's not 40% of fees - that's 40% of what FixedFloat actually earns after costs.

The minimum withdrawal is just 0.001 BTC, and payments go out in whatever cryptocurrency you want from their supported list. Everything tracks in real-time through their affiliate dashboard, so you can see exactly what your referrals are trading and what you're earning. Registration is free, and you don't need to be an existing user to join.

## User Experience in 2026

According to Trustpilot reviews from January 2026, FixedFloat has over 2,100 customer reviews with generally positive feedback. Users consistently mention the speed of transactions and the convenience of not needing to create an account.

One recent reviewer noted: "I've used FixedFloat a few times now, and it's always fast. Transactions are processed quickly, and I haven't had any problems. It's a reliable platform for simple swaps."

Another user who frequently exchanges to Monero commented: "i always use them to exchange to coins like monero due to their no kyc, best service out there even for large amount of money."

However, it's worth noting that FixedFloat does reserve the right to suspend orders and request proof of funds if transactions are flagged as potentially linked to criminal activity. This happens rarely, but it's outlined in their terms of service. The platform cooperates with law enforcement and may freeze funds connected to illicit activities, which is standard practice for legitimate exchanges operating in compliance with anti-money laundering regulations.

## Lightning Network Support

FixedFloat was actually the first major exchange to integrate Bitcoin's Lightning Network back in 2018. If you're not familiar, Lightning Network is Bitcoin's layer-2 solution that enables near-instant transactions with minimal fees.

For Bitcoin traders, this matters. Instead of waiting 30-60 minutes for standard Bitcoin transactions to confirm, Lightning swaps happen in seconds. The fees are negligible compared to on-chain transactions, especially during periods of network congestion.

## Security Approach

Since FixedFloat doesn't hold your funds, the security model is different from traditional exchanges. There's no exchange wallet that could get hacked and drain millions. Each transaction creates a unique address, the swap happens automatically, and funds go straight to your wallet.

The platform has been operating since 2018 without major security incidents (though they did experience a hack in early 2024 from which they recovered, completing a transition to their new ff.io domain in the process). They're legally registered in Seychelles and maintain 24/7 customer support via live chat, Telegram, email, and social media.

## What FixedFloat Doesn't Do

Let's be clear about what you won't find here. There's no mobile app yet (though one's reportedly in development). There's no fiat on-ramp or off-ramp - this is crypto-to-crypto only. You can't store funds on the platform because it's not designed as a wallet or custodial service. There's no advanced trading features, no charts, no margin trading.

FixedFloat is built for one thing: swapping one cryptocurrency for another as quickly and privately as possible. If you want bells and whistles, look elsewhere. If you want efficiency, this might be your spot.

## The Privacy Angle

In an era where Coinbase and Binance know more about you than your accountant does, FixedFloat's approach to privacy stands out. They don't collect personal information for basic swaps. No email required (though you can optionally provide one to track your order). No photo ID. No proof of address.

The blockchain itself is transparent - anyone can see the transactions - but there's no database linking your identity to those transactions. For users who value financial privacy, especially those dealing with privacy-focused coins like Monero or Zcash, this matters.

That said, if a transaction gets flagged for potential criminal connections, FixedFloat can and will request verification. This aligns with their terms of service and legal obligations. It's not a mixer or a completely anonymous service - it's a KYC-free exchange for legitimate users.

## Recent Platform Updates

According to their blog posts from late 2025 and early 2026, FixedFloat has been actively updating the platform. They successfully migrated to the new ff.io domain, added support for new cryptocurrencies like Sonic, and continue expanding their network coverage. Recent news posts show they're tracking major crypto developments and maintaining their service through market volatility.

The platform processed millions in exchange volume throughout 2025, and they're continuing to add new trading pairs and tokens based on community demand.

## Support When You Need It

Customer support operates 24/7 through multiple channels - live chat on the website, email, Telegram, and social media. Response times vary, but most users report getting help within a few hours. For straightforward issues like checking transaction status, the chat tends to be fastest.

Their FAQ section covers the basics pretty well, and they maintain a blog with guides on topics like avoiding scams, understanding network fees, and recovering tokens sent to the wrong network. For technical users, they also offer a comprehensive API for developers wanting to integrate FixedFloat's exchange functionality into their own applications.

## Bottom Line

👉 [Start Exchanging on FixedFloat](https://ff.io)

FixedFloat isn't trying to be everything to everyone. It's a focused tool for crypto swaps that prioritizes speed, privacy, and simplicity over fancy features. The no-KYC approach appeals to users who remember when crypto was supposed to be about financial freedom, not filling out government forms.

The dual-rate system gives you flexibility - pay less and accept market risk, or pay slightly more for certainty. Either way, you're looking at sub-1% fees plus standard network costs, which is competitive with most exchanges once you factor in spreads and hidden fees.

For casual traders who just want to swap coins without drama, or privacy-conscious users who'd rather not hand over their passport to exchange Bitcoin for Ethereum, FixedFloat delivers. Just know what you're getting: a straightforward swap service, not a comprehensive trading platform.

The affiliate program is genuinely good if you've got an audience in the crypto space. And for users who value getting in and out quickly without creating yet another account on yet another platform that'll eventually get hacked or subpoenaed, this approach makes sense.
